# Coronavirus-Tweets-Sentiment-Analysis

## Project Summary -
Once upon a time, there was a team of researchers who were concerned about the public's perception of the COVID-19 pandemic. They wanted to know how people were feeling about the pandemic, what they were saying on social media, and how their sentiments were evolving over time.

So they came up with an idea: a project that would analyze the sentiment of social media posts related to COVID-19. They would collect data from various social media platforms using APIs, preprocess the data, and use machine learning algorithms to classify the posts into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

The team worked hard to develop the machine learning model, training it with various NLP techniques. They also created visualizations to display the sentiment analysis results in real-time.

As the project progressed, the team noticed some interesting trends. At first, there was a lot of fear and uncertainty expressed in social media posts about COVID-19. However, over time, the sentiment began to shift. People were becoming more optimistic and hopeful as vaccines became more widely available. It provided valuable insights into public sentiment towards COVID-19 and helped healthcare organizations and policymakers make informed decisions based on real-time feedback.

## Problem Statement
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, affecting nearly every aspect of daily life. As the pandemic continues to evolve, it is critical to understand how people are feeling about it and what they are saying on social media. The sheer volume of data available on social media platforms makes it difficult to manually analyze public sentiment towards the pandemic. Therefore, there is a need for an automated system that can efficiently collect, preprocess, and classify social media data to provide real-time insights into public sentiment towards COVID-19. This is where the Corona Sentiment Analysis project comes in, aiming to address this problem by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze large amounts of social media data and classify it into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

## Conclusion
Based on the classification reports , it appears that the models I've trained are performing reasonably well on the given dataset, with accuracies ranging from 0.84 to 0.85. The precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes are also fairly balanced, indicating that the models are not biased towards one class or the other. However, there is some variability in these metrics across different models, suggesting that some models may perform better than others on some specific dataset.
It's important to note that the performance of these models on this dataset may not be indicative of their performance on other datasets, or in the real world. Additionally, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and new variants emerge, the sentiment towards the virus and public health measures may change, which could impact the generalizability of these models over time.
